# Firebase Realtime Database Silent Update Failure

This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug encountered with Firebase's Realtime Database.  Despite seemingly correct code, data updates were not reflected in the application.  The `on('value', ...)` listener failed to trigger, leading to a silent failure without any error messages or indications in the Firebase console.

The `firebaseBug.js` file contains the original code that exhibited the problem. The solution, incorporating additional debugging and error handling strategies, is provided in `firebaseBugSolution.js`.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling and advanced debugging techniques when interacting with Firebase.
